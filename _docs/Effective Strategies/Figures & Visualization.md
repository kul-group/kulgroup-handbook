### Step 1

### Step 3

## Making Images

### Guidelines

1. Use descriptive axes and titles, include units, and make the fontsize large (~16 pt.). Include other relevant technical information (like the DFT functional you used) in a textbox below the image.

2. Use appropriate color schemes. [Colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) can help you pick combinations of colors which look good. Use different shades to accomodate colorblind users.

3. Don't put too much data on a single plot. What are you trying to say? Like your writing, your images should "tell a story".

*Note: Many past QE, Prelim, and other presentations can be found on [Box](https://ucdavis.app.box.com/folder/80871253566). Use the images here as a reference: What works? What Doesn't?*
